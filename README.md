# 2D Conveyor Belt Game

## Overview

This game was developed during my first year of studying Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). It is designed using Java Processing.

## Objective

The goal of the game is to place items into the lunchbox as it moves along the conveyor belt before it reaches the end of the screen.
## Images

The game includes multiple levels with an interesting mechanic: bananas spawn vertically, but players must fit them horizontally into the lunchbox. This feature adds complexity and variety to the gameplay experience.
